[Week 1](#day-1-march-12th-2023)

## Day 8: March 19th, 2023

I finally finished the Django lecture! During the rest of the lecture video, I learned more about Django logic within HTML files, as well as several "tricks" that make it easier to control the web application from one spot, rather than scattered across the codebase (for ex. using HTML templates, naming the page that correponds with the URL). I coded along with the example, and now I have one more app in my example project that can display a list of tasks as well as add tasks, all for unique sessions (due to Django tables!). I'll be ready to start Project 1 tomorrow after my last final!

## Day 7: March 18th, 2023

Today, I worked through CS50's Django week. I've just been watching the lecture and I'm about 1 hour in, but I've already learned so much about making dynamic websites that I can host on my local computer. It's so cool that I can implement logic/variables in my HTML file with the Python files that are generated for me with Django. I didn't expect Django to be so beginner friendly, but it's a nice surprise! It feels like I'm "automating" my website creation process, rather than doing it manually through static webpages.

## Day 6: March 17th, 2023

I'll be pretty honest here, I didn't really code much today. Since it's finals week for me, I've been studying for CSE 12/MATH 20E and therefore haven't made much progress coding; rather, I'm studying code :P However, after my CSE 12 final tomorrow, I'll work more through some CS50. I did finish Project 0, however!

## Day 5: March 16th, 2023

I started on a new project today, also on the theme of web dev. CS50 is a pretty popular online course for programming beginners, but I've started going through the [web dev branch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) along with [sbsx](https://github.com/sbsx), which you can check out his projects there :) I mostly finished [Project 0](https://github.com/wanning-lu/cs50w-projects/tree/main/project0-search), which is about using GET requests from HTML forms to perform Google searches from my own web page. It was a fun little project, and it did expand my knowledge about HTML forms (which, tbh, have been quite a weak spot for me).

## Day 4: March 15th, 2023

I finished writing the tests today, although it took much longer than I expected. I also styled the last bit of my PA, but I usually try to style my program as I go. I also just completed around 80-90% of my calculator project; all of the functions work, as well as the clear button. However, implementing the ability to use decimal points is still a WIP...

## Day 3: March 14th, 2023

Today, I mostly focused my efforts on my PA. I finished off the main bulk of the PA previously (impelementing that actual BST) so today I wrote most of the tests. Additionally, if it counts (I'm half-counting it), I finished my preparation for the CSE 15L skill demo, which involved starting a Java server, fixing a JUnit test, and reading up on some Bash to find out how to retrieve a nested file. Tomorrow, I'll probably finish up writing the tests.

## Day 2: March 13th, 2023

I started working on the next TOP project, which is about making a calculator. I haven't finished it yet, but I've made around 30-40% progress so far (HTML/CSS are basically done, starting on JS for the functions). Additionally, I've been working on [my PA](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/cse12-wi23-pa8-BinarySearchTree-Sorting-starter) for CSE 12 (yup, this counts too!), which involves implementing a binary search tree. Finally, an opportunity to use recursion!

## Day 1: March 12th, 2023

I've been working on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for a bit now, on and off, here and there. I've been skimming their "Foundations" course since I already know some fundamentals of web development, such as basic OOP and HTML/CSS. I worked on one [project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-landingpage) prior to the creation of this log, which exercised my ability at using flexbox. Flexbox is absolutely amazing; I feel like if I had known that this existed in my past projects, I wouldn't have wasted so much time fiddling with different settings. Plus, they would all be somewhat responsive. Anyway, I worked on some basic JS today along with some DOM manipulation. Just for fun, I also tried making my HTML button look a little nicer. Here's [the project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-etchasketch), where I created a rudimentary etch-a-sketch composed mostly of JS. This hour of code felt pretty substantial. I feel like I'm genuinely going somewhere this time with web development, rather than floating around looking for resources. If you're still debating whether you should try out TOP, you should just give one of their projects a shot.
