## Day 13: March 24th, 2023

Today, I went through the last 5 lessons in TOP before going on to the forms project. There was quite a bit of content on HTML forms, which I didn't expect; validations and styling were some of the main things that I learned. Additionally, I feel like I finally understand how they work and send information, which I didn't before even when creating forms for FCC/CS50w. I've only created the barebones of the form project as of now, with all of the HTML completed (thanks Emmet!) and some styling applied so it somewhat matches the image.

## Day 12: March 23rd, 2023

I worked on a mix of TOP and CS50w today, starting with coding along with the example project for the lecture. I didn't go too deep into the lecture (about halfway in so far), but I've learned how to set up a database inside Django, specifically models.py along with some Django commands to create it. As for TOP,
I started working through their JS path, which begins with some Intermediate
HTML/CSS. Although some of it was repeat knowledge, I did learn about Emmet and CSS functions/variables which was really useful. I'm almost at the project (sign-up form) but I've gone through about *12* lessons so I think that's something for tomorrow.

## Day 11: March 22nd, 2023

Today, I finished [Project 1](https://github.com/wanning-lu/cs50w-projects/tree/main/project1_wiki) by implementing the "random search" function on the sidebar. It was pretty simple, as all I needed to do was import choice() from random, which allowed me to choose a pseudo?random element from the list of entries every
time. After that, I got started on the 4th lecture, which dove into databases; I watched the entirety of the SQL section, which gave some examples in SQLite on how to create a table and insert/join/delete/search data. The next section will
be on how to work with SQL through Django, so I'm looking forward to that!

## Day 10: March 21st, 2023

TBH, I didn't do much coding today. I was focused on packing and moving back, and the entire day has been dedicated to meeting up with familiar faces.

## Day 9: March 20th, 2023

Made some progress with Project 1 today, up until implementing several search functions. Setting the Django project up definitely requires some practice; even after going through the lecture and following along with every step, I still found myself wondering what commands I needed to use, as well as how I should use certain Django features. There are a **lot** of Django modules that I need to remember to use. After overcoming that initial barrier, however, I've successfully implemented the ability to visit a specific "wiki" page with a url pattern, as well as implement a search function for an existing wiki page. I'll try to finish the project by tomorrow, it seems pretty doable! Also, all of my finals are done, so I'll definitely have a lot of time to dedicate to coding during my break :)

## Day 8: March 19th, 2023

I finally finished the Django lecture! During the rest of the lecture video, I learned more about Django logic within HTML files, as well as several "tricks" that make it easier to control the web application from one spot, rather than scattered across the codebase (for ex. using HTML templates, naming the page that correponds with the URL). I coded along with the example, and now I have one more app in my example project that can display a list of tasks as well as add tasks, all for unique sessions (due to Django tables!). I'll be ready to start Project 1 tomorrow after my last final!

## Day 7: March 18th, 2023

Today, I worked through CS50's Django week. I've just been watching the lecture and I'm about 1 hour in, but I've already learned so much about making dynamic websites that I can host on my local computer. It's so cool that I can implement logic/variables in my HTML file with the Python files that are generated for me with Django. I didn't expect Django to be so beginner friendly, but it's a nice surprise! It feels like I'm "automating" my website creation process, rather than doing it manually through static webpages.

## Day 6: March 17th, 2023

I'll be pretty honest here, I didn't really code much today. Since it's finals week for me, I've been studying for CSE 12/MATH 20E and therefore haven't made much progress coding; rather, I'm studying code :P However, after my CSE 12 final tomorrow, I'll work more through some CS50. I did finish Project 0, however!

## Day 5: March 16th, 2023

I started on a new project today, also on the theme of web dev. CS50 is a pretty popular online course for programming beginners, but I've started going through the [web dev branch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) along with [sbsx](https://github.com/sbsx), which you can check out his projects there :) I mostly finished [Project 0](https://github.com/wanning-lu/cs50w-projects/tree/main/project0-search), which is about using GET requests from HTML forms to perform Google searches from my own web page. It was a fun little project, and it did expand my knowledge about HTML forms (which, tbh, have been quite a weak spot for me).

## Day 4: March 15th, 2023

I finished writing the tests today, although it took much longer than I expected. I also styled the last bit of my PA, but I usually try to style my program as I go. I also just completed around 80-90% of my calculator project; all of the functions work, as well as the clear button. However, implementing the ability to use decimal points is still a WIP...

## Day 3: March 14th, 2023

Today, I mostly focused my efforts on my PA. I finished off the main bulk of the PA previously (impelementing that actual BST) so today I wrote most of the tests. Additionally, if it counts (I'm half-counting it), I finished my preparation for the CSE 15L skill demo, which involved starting a Java server, fixing a JUnit test, and reading up on some Bash to find out how to retrieve a nested file. Tomorrow, I'll probably finish up writing the tests.

## Day 2: March 13th, 2023

I started working on the next TOP project, which is about making a calculator. I haven't finished it yet, but I've made around 30-40% progress so far (HTML/CSS are basically done, starting on JS for the functions). Additionally, I've been working on [my PA](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/cse12-wi23-pa8-BinarySearchTree-Sorting-starter) for CSE 12 (yup, this counts too!), which involves implementing a binary search tree. Finally, an opportunity to use recursion!

## Day 1: March 12th, 2023

I've been working on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for a bit now, on and off, here and there. I've been skimming their "Foundations" course since I already know some fundamentals of web development, such as basic OOP and HTML/CSS. I worked on one [project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-landingpage) prior to the creation of this log, which exercised my ability at using flexbox. Flexbox is absolutely amazing; I feel like if I had known that this existed in my past projects, I wouldn't have wasted so much time fiddling with different settings. Plus, they would all be somewhat responsive. Anyway, I worked on some basic JS today along with some DOM manipulation. Just for fun, I also tried making my HTML button look a little nicer. Here's [the project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-etchasketch), where I created a rudimentary etch-a-sketch composed mostly of JS. This hour of code felt pretty substantial. I feel like I'm genuinely going somewhere this time with web development, rather than floating around looking for resources. If you're still debating whether you should try out TOP, you should just give one of their projects a shot.
