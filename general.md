## Day 1: March 12th, 2023

I've been working on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for a bit now, on and off, here and there. I've been skimming their "Foundations" course since I already know some fundamentals of web development, such as basic OOP and HTML/CSS. I worked on one [project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-landingpage) prior to the creation of this log, which exercised my ability at using flexbox. Flexbox is absolutely amazing; I feel like if I had known that this existed in my past projects, I wouldn't have wasted so much time fiddling with different settings. Plus, they would all be somewhat responsive. Anyway, I worked on some basic JS today along with some DOM manipulation. Just for fun, I also tried making my HTML button look a little nicer. Here's [the project](https://github.com/wanning-lu/top-etchasketch), where I created a rudimentary etch-a-sketch composed mostly of JS. This hour of code felt pretty substantial. I feel like I'm genuinely going somewhere this time with web development, rather than floating around looking for resources. If you're still debating whether you should try out TOP, you should just give one of their projects a shot.

## Day 2: March 13th, 2023

I started working on the next TOP project, which is about making a calculator. I haven't finished it yet, but I've made around 30-40% progress so far (HTML/CSS are basically done, starting on JS for the functions). Additionally, I've been working on [my PA](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/cse12-wi23-pa8-BinarySearchTree-Sorting-starter) for CSE 12 (yup, this counts too!), which involves implementing a binary search tree. Finally, an opportunity to use recursion!
