# Welcome to my coding log!

This will be my means of tracking my programming progress starting 3/13/23. Currently, my goal is to code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. I drew inspiration from [this site](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) as I'm performing the same challenge, just with a more free-flowing structure. In the end, however, the motivations are all the same.

In general, I'll have a markdown page named "general.md" which will update each day with a brief description of what I did during my hour(s) of code. If there's anything special that occurred, I'll create a new markdown page with its corresponding link in the general page.

Good luck to me! And good luck to you if you decide to start a similar journey!
